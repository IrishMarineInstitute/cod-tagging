  <p>The Marine Institute, in partnership with AFBI in Northern Ireland and CEFAS in the UK, are conducting a cod tagging project in the Irish Sea. The project is funded by the European Commission and will see the three research agencies working alongside the fishing industry and recreational fishermen to gain a better understanding of the factors that have an influence on cod (Gadus morhua) in the Irish Sea. More information can be found at these links: <a href="https://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/areas-activity/fisheries-ecosystems/irish-sea-cod-tagging-project">Marine Institute</a> and <a href = "https://www.afbini.gov.uk/articles/cod-tagging-project-irish-sea">AFBINI</a>.</p>
  <p>The aim of this mapping application was to create a graphical data-driven tool to look at the data collected by the Cod tagging program. It visualises the locations of releases and recaptures of the fish using leaflet mapping. These maps can be downloaded as pdfs and can be set based on the zoom. For the recapture data, the user can also customise plots based on the dropdown values available. These plots can be exported as png files if required for reports. There is also a section on the voluntary taggers and how they were trained on how to tag and release cod.</p>
  <p>Below are the links to the source code for each of the phase 1 projects.  As well as source code there is links to docker hub images for running each of the applications</p>
    <p>A Docker image can be created from the Dockerfile in the repo.  Alternatively you can run a container from a pre-created image on our Docker Hub repo<a href ="https://cloud.docker.com/u/informaticsmarine/repository/list"> that can be found here</a>  </p>
