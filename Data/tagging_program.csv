"<h3>The Cod Tagging Program </h3> <p>In order to compliment the tagging work being carried out by AFBI and the Marine Institute as part of a 3 year cod tagging programme running in the Irish Sea, a number of interested anglers and pot fishermen were recruited to tag cod. 16 anglers and 3 pot fishermen located at various sites along the east coast were individually trained by AFBI and Marine Institute tagging staff, and provided with a tagging kit to tag cod at any opportunity that arises for them.</p>","<p>The voluntary taggers consisted of a mixture of boat and shore anglers and pot fishermen who regularly encounter cod while fishing at sea or on the shore. The main aspects of the training provided included assessing whether the cod was healthy enough to be tagged, getting the tagger familiar with the equipment used to tag cod, the insertion and placement of the tags and recording the data.</p>","<p>Recruiting voluntary taggers has huge benefits overall for the project including, stakeholder engagement, number of tags being released, areas being sampled and project outreach.</p>","<p><i><b>Figure 1: Tagging kit including tagging gun, floy tags, datasheets, SOP and reward poster.</b></i></p>",<p><i><b>Figure 2: Marine Institute staff member training Ireland team and South Shore SAC angler Evan Ryan to tag cod on Arklow North Beach.</b></i></p>,<p><i><b>Figure 2: Map showing the locations where Cod tagged by volunteer anglers were released.</b> </i></p>,"<p>The Marine Institute, in partnership with AFBI in Northern Ireland and CEFAS in the UK, are conducting a cod tagging 
project in the Irish Sea. The project is funded by the European Commission and will see the three research 
agencies working alongside the fishing industry and recreational fishermen to gain a better understanding of 
the factors that have an influence on cod (Gadus morhua) in the Irish Sea.

<p>The aim of this mapping application was to create a graphical data-driven tool 
to look at the data collected by the Cod tagging program. It visualises the locations of releases and 
recaptures of the fish using leaflet mapping. These maps can be downloaded as pdfs and can be set based 
on the zoom. For the recapture data, the user can also customise plots based on the dropdown values available. 
These plots can be exported as png files if required for reports. There is also a section on the voluntary 
taggers and how they were trained on how to tag and release cod. </p>"
